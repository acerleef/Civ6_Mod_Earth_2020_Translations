		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_TRUMP">
			<Text>You lead a strong and wealthy nation, Donald Trump, but it is your great ambition to make it stronger and wealthier still. Though your administration has begun under a cloud of controversy, you remain confident in your skill in the art of the deal that you can yet shape events to your will. Can you fulfill your promises, Mr. President, and make America great again?</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_XI">
			<Text>China is growing, and it takes a steady hand, your hand, Xi Jinping, to steer the ship of state upon the proper course. You have learned from the mistakes of the past, and as you maneuver your nation into a position of global leadership you will never forget that true power comes through unquestioned strength. Lead your people well, and you may achieve your "Chinese Dream" of a more glorious nation.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_PUTIN">
			<Text>The Motherland calls for leadership, Vladimir Putin, and it is your honor to answer the call. You seek to recapture the lost days of glory for your nation, returning it to its rightful place of influence on the world stage. You will not let others meddle in Russian affairs, but will fiercely guard your land, your people, and your allies.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_MODI">
			<Text>You lead the world's largest democracy, Narendra Modi, and there are many competing interests you must try to balance as you guide your growing nation towards the future. As a reformer who also seeks to preserve the ancient traditions of your people, you have your work cut out for you. If you succeed, a more prosperous and unified India will arise.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_ABE">
			<Text>More than most, Shinzo Abe, you recognize that Japan is a land of both tradition and progress. You respect the ways of your ancestors and take pride in your nation, but you realize the need for Japan to adapt in these changing times. Apply the lessons of the past to the problems of the present, and you may yet see Japan through to a glorious future.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_MERKEL">
			<Text>You dare to dream of a united Europe, Angela Merkel, but it is a hard thing to turn a dream into reality. Growing up behind the Iron Curtain, it is only natural that you seek to break down barriers between peoples. Your rule has made Germany a steady force on the continent as it weathers many crises, but you still face criticism. Prove the critics wrong, and you may yet realize your dream.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_MAY">
			<Text>Your people zealously guard their independence, Theresa May, and it falls to you to provide leadership as they make their own way in the world. A nation unencumbered by entangling alliances does not have to be isolated, for trade with friends will surely bring great benefit to your shores. Provide strong and stable leadership to your people, and they will prosper.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_MACRON">
			<Text>Forward, Emmanuel Macron, and lead your people to a new era. The old institutions have fallen before you, as you have carved out a new place in French politics and seek to lead your people along the Third Way. If you succeed in bringing reform to France while respecting her values, you will have an achievement for the ages. The Republic is on the march!</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_TEMER">
			<Text>You lead Brazil in a time of trouble, Michel Temer. You came to power because your predecessor was arrested for corruption, and now clouds of scandal hang above your head as well. Yet you are determined to put this all behind you, and lead Brazil to embark upon an ambitious program of reform. Reform is indeed needed, but will you be the one to provide it and lead Brazil towards a brighter future?</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_SALMAN">
			<Text>Blessings upon you, Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, King of Saudi Arabia and Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. You rule the kingdom of your father with an iron hand, tolerating no dissent to your rule and your faith. But to those who walk in the way of righteousness you extend generosity and grace, as befits a wise ruler such as yourself. Lead your people well, that they might be an example to the world.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_SISI">
			<Text>Egypt yearns for strong leadership, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and by God's grace you are the one to provide it. You have chosen to lead your people away from extremism and chaos, providing a steady hand while you reform and improve your ancient land. Like the pharaohs of old, you seek to undertake great building projects that will leave a lasting mark upon your nation. Lead well, and the glory of Egypt will be restored.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_TRUDEAU">
			<Text>There is no time like the present, Justin Trudeau, and at present your people look to you to lead Canada to a better tomorrow. Your father was a giant in Canadian politics, and so it is your task to step out from his shadow and make a grand legacy in your own right. Work hard and listen to others, and when people say the name Trudeau their first thought may be of you.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_TURNBULL">
			<Text>Your ambition suits you, Malcolm Turnbull, and has prepared you to lead a nation so rich and vast as Australia. With consideration for the past and a desire for the future, you seek to provide your people with both continuity and change. It is a difficult task, but you have never been one to shy away from a challenge.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_PENA_NIETO">
			<Text>Your nation is growing, Enrique Peña Nieto, but with growth comes growing pains. You strive to bring greater wealth and security to all your citizens, but the task is not easy in a rich land haunted by poverty and violence. If you can harness the vibrant spirit of Mexico and utilize the strength of a diverse people united, you may yet achieve your goal.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_WIDODO">
			<Text>You desire to be a champion of the people, Joko Widodo, but such a position is not easy. Your far-flung nation of 17,000 islands and many diverse peoples will prove difficult to manage, and to add to your worries are the encroaching navies of stronger powers. But your nation is also blessed to sit at a confluence of trade, and if you make the most of your situation your people will prosper.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_ERDOGAN">
			<Text>Hail, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, unassailable leader of the Republic of Turkey. With the will of the people you have transformed your nation, seeking to revive the ancient glory of your civilization. You tolerate no dissent, and are willing to meet any challenge at home or abroad. Bold leadership can accomplish great things, and with skill you may yet achieve a legacy to rival that of the Sultans.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_MACRI">
			<Text>Argentina is in need of reform, Mauricio Macri, and you have ambitious plans for it. Economic and financial woes must be met with a businessman's acumen, and your background has prepared you for the task. But sometimes necessary medicine is bitter, and staying the course until fruition may prove difficult. Steady yourself and encourage your people, and you may yet lead them to a prosperous future.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_ROUHANI">
			<Text>Peace be upon you, Hassan Rouhani, devout president of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Your nation is a proud theocracy, forged in the fires of revolution to protect and promote the national version of Shia Islam. Your people seek to create a new world order and establish a global peace, but it will be a difficult task to balance the competing interpretations of this vision. With moderation and devotion, you may achieve your aim.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_ABBASI">
			<Text>You are a loyal servant, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, both to your people and your party. Unexpected events brought you to power, but you are determined to leave your mark. Many challenges face you, but you have assembled a large and talented cabinet to assist you in the daunting task of ruling a nation. Work hard and listen to sound advice, and Pakistan will be grateful for your leadership.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_ZUMA">
			<Text>You have come far, Jacob Zuma, rising from humble beginnings to attain the Presidency of South Africa. You faced many struggles: against poverty, against apartheid, against political machinations, and against scandal. Through it all you have persisted, and emerged stronger than ever. May your determination be an example to all who come after you, and may it help you to rule your nation well.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_BUHARI">
			<Text>You are a changed man, Muhammadu Buhari, and now you need to bring change to your people as well. Once you were an oppressive dictator, but now you are a reformed democrat comitted to tolerance and transparency. But still you need a fighting spirit, as you will have to combat corruption, poverty, and terrorism. If you triumph over these troubles, you will be celebrated by all Nigeria for all time.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_MOON">
			<Text>You seek peace, Moon Jae-in, but are haunted by the shadows of war. Your parents escaped the dictatorship of the North during the Korean War, and you yourself fought for human rights against the dictatorship of the South. Now you have been entrusted with the leadership of a free and propserous people, but your journey will not be complete unless you can bring about a lasting peace. May heaven bless your endeavor.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_KIM">
			<Text>All hail the Supreme Leader, Kim Jong-un, descendent of the Eternal Leaders of Juche Korea, champion of the people, protector of the revolution, and rightful ruler of an indivisible Korea. Your humble servants wait with baited breath for your command, and all Korea seeks to serve your will, whatever the cost. There are many enemies who are jealous of your glory, but with the strength of the people your victory is assured.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_NETANYAHU">
			<Text>The defense of your homeland is your prime concern, Benjamin Netanyahu, and you are willing to do anything to keep your people safe. While you have many critics, your hardline tactics have won you the trust of your embattled nation, which has elected you leader more times than anyone other than its founding father. The way forward may be dangerous, but with a firm resolve, and the blessing of God, you will triumph.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_GENTILONI">
			<Text>You did not seek the office, Paolo Gentiloni, but a life of public service has been rewarded with the position of Prime Minister. Your fellow ministers have faith in you; now you must earn the trust of your people. Your people seek solutions to the troubles of the day, but they will not be led blindly and will oppose you unless you serve their interests. Lead them well, and you will prove worthy of your position.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_AMLO">
			<Text>Change is in the air in Mexico, AMLO, as you seek to lead your people in a new direction. You promise to fight corruption, bring peace, improve education, and champion equality.

		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_BOLSONARO">
			<Text>Your sharp tongue often gets you in trouble, Jair Bolsonaro, but when you turned it against the corrupt elite of your nation your people listened and entrusted you to lead them. You have promised to bring renewal and justice to your nation, a tall order in a country plagued by corruption, violence, and poverty. The road ahead is long, but you are determined to make your country great.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_FERNANDEZ">
			<Text>Your nation looks to you, Alberto Fernández, to bring about rejuvenation in the land. Argentina suffers from recession and massive public debt, and it needs wise leadership to put things right. If you can provide that leadership, you will make a name for yourself and step out from the shadow of the political bosses who helped orchestrate your rise.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_JOHNSON">
			<Text>You are an unusual politician for Britain, Boris Johnson, an eccentric both vulgar and erudite, but these are unusual times. Entering the fray at a time of political chaos and uncertainty, you took the reins of a beleaguered party and led it to an electoral triumph not seen in a generation. Now comes the hard task of governing, of fulfilling your promises, and leading your nation towards greater independence. It is a role you believe you were born to play.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_CONTE">
			<Text>It was law but not politics that was your vocation, Giuseppe Conte, but when a divided nation looked to you for leadership you answered the call. You have navigated the rough waters of squabbling partisans, and done much to work towards unity in a fractured polity. But the work is not yet finished, and the people still desire reform. If you can complete the tasks before you, you know that your people will be stronger together.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_RAMAPHOSA">
			<Text>You have already achieved great things, Cyril Ramaphosa, yet you are not content to rest on your laurels. You played a pivotal role in ending apartheid and have achieved great personal success in business, but now your people need you once more. South Africa faces many difficulties, and if you can overcome them, as you have overcome so many things before, you will earn a lasting place in their hearts.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_KHAN">
			<Text>You like to set lofty goals, Imran Khan, and your current goal is the most ambitious yet. Having achieved victory on the playing field and at the ballot box, you now seek to win in the realm of policy, remaking your nation in a better image. If you can overcome the entrenched interests, your goal of creating a more just and egalitarian state while respecting tradition will be your greatest victory.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_LOADING_INFO_LEADER_MORRISON">
			<Text>You govern a vast and prosperous nation, Scott Morrison, and you bring to the job a history of solid performance. You have often exceeded expectations, but there is always room for improvement. Be careful not to let events get ahead of you, for in this land down under one must always be prepared for the unexpected if one is to thrive.</Text>

A polarizing figure from the start, Trump made many enemies, and acolytes, with a blunt, often insulting manner of speech and a campaign focused on unapologetic nationalism. Fortunately for Trump, his opponent in the general election was the only other person as unpopular as he, Hillary Clinton, allowing him to pull out an upset victory by winning a clear majority of electoral votes. In his short tenure Trump has made many changes, pulling out of treaties he deemed detrimental to American interests, rescinding regulations, taking a new tack in foreign policy, and promising to work for reform in taxes and law. His administration has been marred by controversy and scandal, most prominently questions of ties to Russia, and it remains to be seen if he can put this behind him and establish a legacy of greatness as he promised his supporters.</Text>

When term-limited by the Russian Constitution, he had his right-hand man run in his stead, although it was widely assumed he pulled the strings behind the curtain. Following this interlude, he returned to the presidency in his own right in 2012.

After college and studying at various Hindu temples, Modi went to work for the RSS, writing texts and serving as a regional organizer.  Later, Modi was assigned by the RSS to help get their favored candidates for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) elected, a task he proved skillful at. In reward for his efforts, the BJP appointed him Chief Minister for the state of Gujarat. His early term as Chief Minister was marred by the 2002 Gujarat riots, anti-Muslim violence that resulted in numerous deaths and significant property damage and displacement. Modi was criticized for his handling of the riots, but the BJP refused his resignation and he won the subsequent election for his party. In his later terms as Chief Minister, Modi focused on economic growth for Gujarat, managing to make the state the most busiiness friendly in India and one with an above-average rate of growth. Modi would use his success in Gujarat as a key selling point when the BJP entrusted him with party leadership going into the 2014 elections.</Text>

Educated in both Japan and America, Abe worked briefly for Kobe Steel before entering government service. Abe transitioned from the bureaucracy to the legislature following his father's death and slowly rose through the leadership positions of his party, the long-reigning Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). He eventually attained the position of Prime Minister, the youngest in Japanese history, but resigned shortly thereafter due to health reasons. A few years later his party, following a long decline in popularity, lost power for only the second time in its history. Abe returned to a leadership position in politics and staged a comeback for his party, returning it to power and himself to the Prime Minister's position in 2012. As a generally conservative politician interested in financial reform and increasing nationalism, Abe has provided stable if occasionally controversial leadership. Whether he will succeed in his vision of strengthening Japan, with its population aging and declining while its neighbors grow stronger, remains the great test of his future.</Text>

			<Text>Hailing from a middle class family in central Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto had political ambitions from a young age. Earning degrees in law and business administration, Nieto worked briefly in the private sector before serving in various appointed political positions. In the early 2000s he entered electoral politics, first winning a position in his hometown before going on to win the governorship of the State of Mexico. Nieto entered office with the ambitious plan to deliver on 608 promises to the people, and while not all of them were achieved he did manage to make great strides in infrastructure and healthcare in the state. Following his term as governor he ran for president and won, bringing his party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), back to power after 12 years in the opposition. As president, Nieto was able to cooperate with several of the other political parties to implement various educational, financial, and telecommunications reforms. Nieto has also increased the size of the federal law enforcement divisions in Mexico to try to combat widespread violence perpetrated by the various drug cartels. Reform of the energy sector, to include ending the government oil monopoly, was also attempted without success due to political opposition. Nieto has also faced controversy, especially concerning the issue of media influence and the use of force in keeping the peace.</Text>

			<Text>Born in Istandbul, Recep Tayyip Erdogan earned a business degree and played semi-pro association football (soccer) before entering politics. Erdogan joined an Islamist political party and won election as mayor of Istanbul, proving himself a talented and effective governor. His party was later proscribed for posing a threat to the secular character of Turkish government, and Erdogan himself was imprisoned after a public reading of a poem which included the line “our mosques are our barracks, the domes our helmets, the minarets our bayonets, and the faithful our soldiers”. Although the term of imprisonment was short, the punishment included a life-long ban from running for election. Undeterred, Erdogan started his own political party, which soon won parliamentary elections. The law banning him from electoral participation was lifted shortly before this victory, allowing him to ride the wave to power and become prime minister. During his administration, Erdogan made peace with the Kurds, shepherded his country successfully through economic turmoil, and invested in infrastructure, healthcare, and education. He also consolidated power, started transitioning Turkey from a secular state to a more Islamist one, cracked down on dissent, and watched as several of his political allies were exposed as corrupt. In 2014 he ran for and won the position of President of Turkey, a formerly symbolic position that he has since transformed into a powerful executive office. In 2016 a failed coup against Erdogan gave him an excuse to crack down on dissent, arresting or firing thousands of political enemies and censoring unfavorable press. In 2017 Erdogan pushed a constitutional revision to further consolidate power, the revision narrowly winning in an election marred by accusations of fraud. With his increasingly authoritarian tendencies and his penchant for Ottoman aesthetics, some have accused him of conspiring to become a modern day Sultan.</Text>

			<Text>The son of a wealthy industrialist, Mauricio Macri earned a degree in civil engineering and followed his father's footsteps into business. He had a varied career in the private sector, working in construction, finance, and sports management. In 1991, at the age of 32, Macri was kidnapped by a group of officers of the Argentine Federal Police and held for 12 days until his father paid a multi-million dollar ransom for his release. This event sparked an interest in politics, and in 2003 he entered a political career himself, founding a new party and running for mayor of Beunos Aires. He lost, but gained much experience in the process, and after merging his party with another to form the Republican Proposal (PRO) he won a seat in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies in 2005. In 2007 Macri ran again for mayor of Buenos Aires, this time winning the office, in which he would serve two terms. Macri's time as mayor was generally successful, including a major overhaul of the city's public transportation and a reform of the police service. In 2015 Macri ran for the presidency of Argentina on a platform of reversing many of the policies of the Kirchners, a politcal dynasty that had held the presidency since 2003. Macri's opponent wanted to preserve the Kirchner legacy, and the close election went to a run-off in which Macri narrowly won. Macri's election was seen as the country taking a turn to the right, and he has embarked on an ambitious plan of economic reform to try to revitalize the economy and overcome the budget issues that have plagued the government for over a decade. He has also shifted foreign policy and sought to increase trade with many other nations.</Text>

After revolution came with the overthrow of the last Shah of Iran, Rouhani was elected to parliament.

Winning the presidency in 2013, Rouhani is generally seen as more moderate than his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, although Iran has continued its pursuit of a nuclear program as well as its support for the Assad dictatorship in Syria and various terrorist groups. The ultimate power in Iran, of course, rests not with the president but with the Supreme Leader Ali Khomeini, a Muslim cleric whose approval is required both to pass laws and to run for office in the nation, so Rouhani’s exact level of control over Iran’s policies is difficult to discern.</Text>

After release he left South Africa and worked for both the ANC and the communists in their underground activities, rising to leadership positions in both. When the ban on the ANC was rescinded in 1990, Zuma returned to South Africa, left the communist party, and worked to build the ANC in his home province. After the ANC won the government in 1994, Zuma was elected as party chair. Five years later he became Deputy President of South Africa, a position he held for six years. Following a brief hiatus, Zuma ran in the ANC primary for president and won decisively, guaranteeing his election to the highest office in a nation that has only elected the ANC since democratic elections were instituted.

He quit and founded an anti-terror institute following the death of his brother during a hostage rescue mission. Later he served as Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, before entering politics as a member of the conservative Likud party. After achieving leadership of the party, Netanyahu was elected Prime Minister in 1996, becoming the youngest prime minister in Israeli history and the first born in Israel after the foundation of the modern Jewish state. A series of scandals and a failure to move the Israeli-Palestinian peace process forward led to his defeat in the following election, after which he reentered the private sector. In the early 2000s he returned to politics to serve as Finance Minister in Ariel Sharon’s administration once Likud had regained power. While in this position Netanyahu implemented a series of economic reforms that improved the nation’s economic situation. Disagreements within Likud led to a fracturing of the party, following which Netanyahu regained leadership of the party. He served as leader of the opposition for three years before once again being elected prime minister. A hardliner on foreign policy, Netanyahu has promoted a strong defense of the nation, which has helped him retain popularity despite weathering many storms.

			<Text>One of six children from a middle class family in southeastern Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro started his career as a military man, serving in the Brazilian army for 15 years.  His career took a turn when he published an article in a national magazine criticizing the government for their handling of the military, especially criticizing low pay.  This article made him many enemies but also many supporters, so after a criminal case in which he was acquitted he left the military and took up politics. In 1988 he was elected to the city council in Rio de Janeiro, and in 1990 he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house in the national legislature.  Over the course of a 27 year career as a deputy he remained a polarizing figure, eventually becoming a champion for the political right wing despite a long history of controversial statements.  In 2018, with Brazil's traditional political establishment discredited by a string of scandals, he siezed the opportunity to run for president.  Running on a campaign of fighting corruption and crime while upholding traditional values, Bolsonaro gradually increased his support throughout the campaign.  A significant event happened during the campaign when he suffered an assassination attempt, being stabbed while meeting with potential voters.  After a month of recovery, he was back on the campaign trail, and Bolsonaro surprised many by winning the first round and then the runoff to become President of Brazil.  As president he has generally moved policy in a more rightward direction.</Text>

After graduation he entered politics, serving in advisory and ministerial roles for many years. In 2000 he was elected to the Buenos Aires City Legislature, where he remained until 2003 when he was appointed Chief of Cabinet Ministers by President Néstor Kirchner. Fernandez served in this role for both Kirchner's tenure and part of his successor (and wife) Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. After this, Fernandez served in minor roles for his party, until in 2019 Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner asked him to run for president, with her as vice president. They managed to win the election against incumbent Mauricio Macri, thereby returning their party to power. As president, Fernandez has embarked on a series of economic reforms, attempting to end the recession that Argentina is in.</Text>

			<Text>Born in New York City to middle class British parents, Boris Johnson has shown ambition since an early age.  Attending Eton College and Oxford University, he cultivated relationships with connected individuals and sought various student offices. After graduating from university he settled in London, where he entered the field of journalism. While working for The Daily Telegraph, Johnson developed a higher profile with his eccentric style and first began promoting the euroscepticism that would come to define his career. Johnson's first foray into politics was a failed run as the Conservative candidate in a safe Labour district in 1997, after which he returned to the news business. In 1999 he became the editor of The Spectator, a tenure marked by controversy, scandal, and an even greater profile on the public scene. In 2001 he ran for Parliament again, this time successfully. As an MP his popularity in Conservative circles increased, culminating in him being appointed shadow education secretary by David Cameron. In 2008 he ran for mayor of London and defeated the incumbent, going on to serve as mayor for two terms, during which the city hosted the Olympics. In 2015 he once again became a Member of Parliament, and in 2016 he became one of the leading voices for the Leave side of the Brexit debate. When Leave won, Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron, a Remain proponent, resigned, and was replaced by Theresa May, who appointed Johnson Foreign Secretary. In 2018 Johnson resigned this post over disagreements with May over Brexit implementation. In 2019 May resigned from the office of Prime Minister over the impasse in Parliament on Brexit implementation, and Johnson ran and won the leadership of the Conservative party, becoming Prime Minister. As Prime Minister, Johnson had no better luck then May with the impasse in Parliament, opting to call snap elections to resolve the issue. Johnson went on to lead his party to one of the largest victories in decades, securing a significant majority that will make legislating much easier for him in the future. As his marquee issue, he has promised to get Brexit done.</Text>

			<Text>Born and raised in southern Italy, Guiseppe Conte attended law school in Rome before embarking on a career as a law professor. In 2013, at the age of 49, he was elected by the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house of the Italian Parliament) to serve as a member of the Bureau of Administrative Justice. After the 2018 election left the Pariament split between the centrist Five Star Movement, right-wing League coalition, and left-wing Democratic Party, a deadlocked parliament finally consented to a compromise by elevating the independent Conte to Prime Minister of a Five Star Movement-League cabinet. Conte worked with this populist coalition to bring about reforms, but rising disagreements led to a dissolution of this government when the League partners voted for no confidence.  However, before new elections could take place a new coalition formed between the Five Star Movement and the Democratic Party, which retained Conte as Prime Minister. Thus Conte became the first Prime Minister in Italian history to lead two separate governments of varying ideologies in the same legislative session. Conte has continued to work with his new government to enact reforms, with the result of his tenure so far being an array of left, right, and center reforms to policy.</Text>

			<Text>Born to a middle class family in Johannesburg, Cyril Ramaphosa attended university to study law, where he became involved in student groups resisting apartheid. After a stint in jail due to his activism, Ramaphosa became a law clerk and finished his degree by correspondence. He then joined the legal department of the Council of Unions of South Africa, where he was tasked with forming a miner's union that would become the National Union of Mineworkers. Ramaphosa would lead this union from its formation in 1982 until 1991, growing it susbstantially and using it to advocate for workers' rights and against apartheid. Achieving greater prominence in the anti-apartheid movement, Ramaphosa became a part of the committee that would negotiate the release of many anti-apartheid political prisoners, including Nelson Mandela. Following this, he was elected Secretary General of the African National Congress (ANC) in 1991, a role in which he played a key part in negotiating the end of apartheid. When free elections were held in 1994, Ramaphosa became a member of parliament. In 1997 he ran unsuccessfully for the presidency, after which he entered the private sector as an investor. His business dealings would prove successful, eventually making him one of the richest men in South Africa. In 2012 he returned to politics, being elected Deputy President of the ANC. Two years later he was appointed Deputy President of South Africa, and three years after that he was elected President of the ANC. When the president of the country, Jacob Zuma, resigned in 2018, Ramaphosa was elected unopposed to succeed him. Ramaphosa would lead his party to its sixth straight win in the 2019 elections. As President, he has focused on improving South Africa's economy, strengthening foreign relations, and promoting tourism. His economic reforms have included job programs and land reforms, controversially supporting the expropriation of land without compensation. He has also pledged to fight corruption in government.</Text>

			<Text>Hailing from an upper-middle class family in Lahore, Imran Khan was afforded a quality education that culminated in a degree from Oxford in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics. But his true love was cricket, and he was good at it, so after graduation he embarked on a career in the sport. In a career spanning nearly two decades he distinguished himself as one of the leading athletes in the sport, culminating with leading the Pakistan national team to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup. After retiring from cricket, Khan focused on philanthropy and politics. In 1996 he founded the Pakistan Movement for Justice (PTI) political party, with the aim of fighting corruption and establishing a welfare state. In 1999 he supported General Pervez Musharraf's coup, hoping he would clean up the corruption in government, but by 2007 he had become disillusioned with the new government and along with many other MPs resigned his position in Parliament. Khan was subsequently placed under house arrest for criticizing the government, but managed to escape. The Musharraf regime ended in 2008, allowing Khan to come out of hiding. Starting in 2011 Khan embarked on a speaking tour criticizing the government, in the process greatly increasing his political popularity. In 2013 he led his party to a modest success in the election, with PTI becoming the third largest party in parliament. Khan criticized the integrity of the elections, claiming vote rigging and leading protests against the government, but nothing was definitively proven. In the next elections in 2018 he led his party to victory, becoming Prime Miniser in the process. As Prime Minister he has focused on fighting corruption, reducing government waste, building a welfare state, ending terrorism in the country as peacefully as possible, and building stronger foreign relations with various nations.</Text>

			<Text>Scott Morrison grew up in a middle class family in the suburbs of Sydney. He had a brief career as a TV child actor, and later attended the University of New South Wales to study economic geography. After graduation, he worked for the lobbying group Property Council of Australia for six years and then worked on the Australian Tourism Task Force for three. In 1998 he moved to New Zealand to serve as director of the Office of Tourism and Sport. In 2000 he returned to Australia to become the director of the Liberal Party in New South Wales, in which capacity he served until 2004, when he was appointed to director of Tourism Australia. In 2007 he was elected to parliament, quickly moving to the front benches and serving in the shadow cabinet. When the Liberal Party won the majority in the 2013 elections, Morrison was appointed Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, at which post he successfully reduced illegal immigration to Australia. In 2014 he was moved to Minister of Social Services, and in 2015 he was appointed Treasurer by the new PM Malcolm Turnbull. After several leadership spills prompted Turnbull to resign in 2018, Morrison was seen as a compromise candidate between the bickering factions of the party and was elected Prime Minister. In 2019 he led his party to a surprise victory in the elections, strengthening its position in parliament. As Prime Minister he has focused on trade and foreign relations, tax reform, and various other measures. In 2020 his popularity took a major hit after criticism that he had been slow to act to deal with the massive bushfires that swept a large portion of the country.</Text>
